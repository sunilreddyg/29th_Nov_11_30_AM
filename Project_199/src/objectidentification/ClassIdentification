/*
		Working with Class Identifier:-->
		 
		 	Note:--> In general class identify group of objects.
		 			But Some times developer use class as unique property. So
		 			in that case we can use class property to identify
		 			single object..
		 			
		 Rules to Follow while using class property:-->
		 
		  		=> Check duplication of class before use
		 		=> Don't use class property value along with spaces
		 		=> because developer use spaces with in class to define
		 			multiple class properties..
		  
		  for Example:-->
		  		<div  class="navigation  Signin_link">
		   
		 			By.className("navigation Signin_link")   ----> Wrong
		 			[Dont' use classname with spaces perticularly when using classname as property]
		   			
		  			By.className("navigation")
		   					[OR]
		  			By.className("Signin_links")      
		  			=> Make sure duplication of class individually before use it..
		 		
		 	Note:--> While defining class property along with Xpath
		 			and cssSelector locators we can include spaces...
		 
		 				By.xpath("//div[@class='navigation  Signin_link']")
		 				By.cssSelector("div[class='navigation Signin_link']")
