Informal Testing types:-->


Exploratory Testing?
	Usually, this process will be carried out by domain experts. 
	They perform testing just by exploring the functionalities of the 
	application without having the knowledge of the requirements.


Adhoc testing:-->

	Ad-hoc testing is quite opposite to the formal testing.
	It is an informal testing type.In Adhoc testing, 
	testers randomly test the application without following any
	documents and test design techniques.

	When Adhoc testing should follow?
		When time is exceeded 
		When client is expected quick release
		When test team have incomplete documentation 

Monkey Testing?
	Perform abnormal action on the application deliberately in order 
	to verify the stability of the application.

Gorilla Testing:-->
	
	perform repeated testing on perticular module/function in order to check
	stability of application

What are the principles of Software Testing?
	1. Testing shows presence of defects
	2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
	3. Early testing
	4. Defect clustering
	5. Pesticide Paradox
	6. Testing is context depending
	7. Absence of error fallacy


1. What is Exhaustive Testing?
	Testing all the functionalities using all valid and invalid inputs 
	and preconditions is known as Exhaustive testing.

2. What is Early Testing?
	Defects detected in early phases of SDLC are less expensive to fix. 
	So conducting early testing reduces the cost of fixing defects.

3. What is Defect clustering?
	Defect clustering in software testing means that a small module or 
	functionality contains most of the bugs or it has the most operational 
	failures.

4. What is Pesticide Paradox?
	Pesticide Paradox in software testing is the process of repeating the same test
	again and again, eventually, the same test cases will no longer find new defects.
	So to overcome this Pesticide Paradox, it is necessary to review the test
	cases regularly and add or update them to find more defects.

5. What is Defect Cascading in Software Testing?

	Defect cascading in Software testing it means triggering of other defects in an
	application. When a defect is not identified or goes unnoticed while testing, it
	invokes other defects.

6. Absence of error fallacy:-->

	If software is unstable it is no matter how many defects find by the testing 
	team when software is not meeting client wishes.

==========================================================================================================>>
Test metrics:-->

	Test execution and execution results play vital role in testing. So that
	testing team regularly report execution result to test lead.

		1. Base metric
		2. Calcualated metric

	
	Base metric:-->

		Testlead collect information from every test engineer
				
		1. Number of testcase executed per day
		2. Number of defects identified
		3. Number of passed testcases
		4. Number of failed testcase
		5. Number of testcase uncovered
		6. Number of high seviority defects found
		7. How many testccase have been designed today per requirement
		8. How many testcase are pending
				
				
	Calculated metrics:-->
	        By collection all base metrics test lead prepare calculated metrics
		and forward to project manager and client.
	
		Mostly calculated metrics designed in Graphs and Pie Charts



	Advantages of metrics:-->
		Every day monitoring tester work it will helps to findout what was the 
		pending work with in project.

		If there is a delay in testing at least we can request a client some more
		day for release.
===================================================================================

RTM:-->[Requirement tracability metrics]

	 Mapping Related testcase to Requirements
			1. Forward tracability
			2. Backward tracability

		
		1. Forward Tracability

				Login      [Tc001,Tc002,Tc003,T004,Tc005]
				Logout	   [Tc021,Tc022,Tc023]

		2. backward tracability

				[Tc031,Tc0032---Tc050]  ------> registration


		Advantages of RTM:-->
			
				1. Easy to find regression testcase

Linked Defects:-->

		Mapping failed Testcase to Defects


=====================================================================================
QA-Signoff:->
	After completed testexecution test lead prepare QA signoff Report.
	
	What Signoff document contains:-->

		=> What are the tasks assigned to qa team and
			how many are finished
		=> How Many new testcases are desinged
		=> How many total testcase executed
		=> How many defects are reported
		=> How many defects are differed
		=> Final Closure report
