Note:-->
	Because webdriver is a API, We need to configure environment 
	before start automation tests.

	=> Later we extract zip file. This process give couple of jar files and we add these
		jar files  to  javaproject...
=========================================================================================================
Note:--> After completed required downloads follow below 
	 configuration to setup project....


WebDriver Configuration:-->

1. Create workspace:-->
		=> Workspace store your projects.
		=> Create folder at any drive and name it as "selenium-workspace"
		=> Create sub folder and name it as "Selenium_libraries"
		=> Dump all selenium executable jar files into "selenium libraries" folder


2. Launch eclipse using above wokspace:-->

		=>Double click on Eclipse ICON
		=>Browser workspace and click ok button.
		=>For the first time we recieve welcome banner, Close welcome banner
			to reach workbench..

3. Create java project:-->

		=> Open Eclipse --> File Menu ----> Use New Option --->select project
			--> open java folder ---> Select javaproject --> Enter projectname
			---> click on finish..
		=> After project creation find it under package explorer.
		=> Expand project to watch default architecture of simple java project..

		ProjectName
			src
			JRE-SystemLibraries


4. Configure selenium libraries to java project:-->
		
		=> By adding these jar files we can design and execute selenium programs
		   under java project..

		=> Under project 
		--> Right click on JRE libraries 
		--> Select build path 
		--> and then select configure buildpath 
		=> It opens project properties window along with java libraries.
		=> Click [Add external Jars] button 
		=> And browser all selenium executable libraries..
