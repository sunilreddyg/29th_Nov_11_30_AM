Agile Process:-->

	=> Agile is a iterative developement model.
	=> In agile total software divided into smaller stories.
	=> A set of stories organization develop and release 
		iteration wise.
	=> An iteration is a small period of time where 
	   fully functional software developed and release 
	   to client with in 1 to 2weeks of time.

	What is advantage to client?.

		=> Welcome chanage requriments even at developement.

	sprint:-->
		Sprint is a duration of time where a few userstories 
		developed end to end.


	What is the difference between iteration and sprint:-->
		
		=> When software successfully release to the
			client is called iteration

		=> Sprint can stop any time and plan for 
			new sprints incase information is
			lacking from client


Scrum:-->
	=> Popular developement framework in agile..

	Scrum Users:-->
		1. Product Owner    [Business Analyst]
		2. Scrum Master     
		3. Developement Team  and  QA Team

	Step1:-->
		product owner collect initial requirements and 
		Prepare usecases

	What is UseCase?.
		A Specific Requirement Based on StakeHolder View.
		=> It is a documented description it contains 
			everything to develop and test software.

			=> PreCondition to Follow
			=> Post Condition to Follow
			=> Actors [Persons involve in software usage]
			=> Business Conditions and Special Requirements


		To Understand Usercase to Every Team member Product
		owner convert into UserStories.

		[User stories are usefull to improve communication
			between business team and technical team]

		UserStory:-->
		A small narration of  requirement what client is
		expecting..

		As a ------I want ------So That

		=> As a customer i want to add products to cart
		=> As a Merchant i want to add new product So that 
				user can purchase
							
	    Note:--> All user stories will be added to backup folder..


		What is scenarios in Agile?

		=>Scenarios are designed in gherkin language
		=>It is a plain language which can convert
			plain text into automation code.
		=> Each user story may contain set of scenarios

		
		Scenario:  Given Site  url
			   When user Search for Product
			   Then prodcut should be display in Page
		
		Scenario:   Given Site url
			    And user search for product
			    When User click on add to product
			    Then product should add to cart

		

	What is Epic:-->
		=> Epic is a large reqruiement and 
			epic contains set of scenarios.
			 


	Step2:-->	[Dynamic planning/ High Level Planning]

		=> product owner select few user stories from
			back up folder 
		=> Scrum master create sprint and assign user stories to sprint

		=> Sprint is a duration of small period of time where
			all user stories to develop and test.
		=> All Development and testing process monitor
			by [Scrum master].
		=> If any user story is incomplete Send user story
			back to backup folder and then user story
			will be reassingned in another sprint.

	Step3:-->
		=> Scrum Master assign userstories to 
		   Correspondent team members.
		=> After userstories assignment develpemenet team 
		   and testing team create sub tasks.


		Develpoer task1:--> Write a program for user story
		Developer task2:--> Draw a flowgraphs to programs
		Develoepr task3:--> Complete unit Testing

		Tester task4:-->  Conduct manual test
		Tester taks5:-->  prepare automation code
		Tester task6:-->  Debug program before execution
		Tester task7:-->  Reporting failure defects
		Scrum Master:-->  prepare metrics for sprint..  


		Note:--> After completing each task developer,
			testengineer and other team memebers move 
			all taks from Inprogress state to done state.


	Story points:-->
		Because story points represent the effort 
		to develop a story
					
	Who provide this story point:-->

		Everyone who involve int0 userstory developement 
		[Developer, Tester, Operational Team, Metric ---etc]

	What Goes Into a Story Point?

	The amount of work to do
	The complexity of the work
	Any risk or uncertainty while doing the work


				Developement :-->  5   
				Tester	     :-->  3
				Operationals :-->  2

			

	What is Burndown chart:-->
	    => Burndown chart prepare by scrum master,
	       it is usefull to track developer and Tester
		progress of work

	    => Use the Burndown Chart to track the 
		total work remaining for a sprint, 
		and to project the likelihood of achieving 
		the sprint goal.
 
		=> By tracking the remaining work throughout 
	  	 the iteration, a team can manage its progress 
	  	 and respond accordingly.

Meeting:-->

		=> Sprint Planning
		=> StandUp meeting
		=> Iteration meeting
		=> Retrospective meeting
